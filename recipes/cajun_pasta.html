<h3> Description</h3>
<p> 
    Nothing says simple like a one pot dinner recipe and this creamy cajun sausage pasta recipe is exactly that! This 30-minute meal is perfect for those weeknight dinners when we're craving something that's luxuriously creamy with a spicy kick. It's an easy gluten-free recipe that's also customizable for those who prefer a little less heat (or more!) or would like it even creamier (or less creamy too!).
</p>

<h3> Ingredients</h3>
<ul> 
    <li>13 oz. andouille sausage links (about 4 links), sliced into medallions</li>
    <li>6 oz. fresh baby bella mushrooms, cleaned and thinly sliced</li>
    <li>½ medium red bell pepper, stemmed, seeds removed, and thinly sliced</li>
    <li>½ medium yellow bell pepper, stemmed, seeds removed, and thinly sliced</li>
    <li>3 large cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>12 oz. gluten-free penne pasta</li>
    <li>½ cup diced fire-roasted tomatoes</li>
    <li>3 ½ cups chicken broth</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons McCormick Grill Mates Louisiana Cajun Seasoning (*see notes!)</li>
    <li>7 oz. cream cheese</li>
    <li>fresh Italian parsley (optional), finely chopped</li>
    <li>red pepper flakes (optional) </li>
</ul>

<h3> Steps</h3>
<ol> 
    <li>Add the sausage to a large skillet or braiser over medium heat and sear the sausage medallions on both sides, until they crisp up a bit, about 4 minutes total (see notes). Remove and set aside on a paper towel lined plate. Don’t get rid of that sausage oil!</li>
    <li>Add the mushrooms, peppers, and garlic to the same skillet you cooked the sausage in and sauté for about 3 minutes, or just until the mushrooms begin to brown.</li>
    <li>Next, add the pasta, fire-roasted tomatoes, chicken broth, and cajun seasoning to the skillet. Stir just until everything is evenly combined, then place a lid on top and allow the broth to come up to a boil.</li>
    <li>Once boiling, turn the heat down to medium and let the pasta simmer for roughly 12-15 minutes (see notes), stirring every couple of minutes until the pasta is tender and cooked al dente.</li>
    <li>Add the cream cheese to the skillet in chunks and stir until it has completely melted and created a thick and creamy sauce.</li>
    <li>Add the sausage back into the skillet, give everything another big stir, top the pasta with a sprinkling of fresh Italian parsley and red pepper flakes aaand SERVE! </li>
</ol>
