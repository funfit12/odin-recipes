<h3> Description</h3>
<p>
    Puerto Rican Chicken Soup (Sopa de Pollo Boricua) is soul warming and heavenly delicious! This is not your traditional chicken soup! What makes Puerto Rican Sopa de Pollo amazing and above regular chicken soup? Its natural homemade savory chicken broth. The chicken broth is made from cooking whole pieces of chicken right into the soup and then flavored with plenty of Latin seasonings! Although hyper simple to make, this will be the best chicken soup you will ever make!
